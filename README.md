# Customer-Relationship-Manager-Spring-Hibernate
I have created a Customer-Relationship-Manager web application using Spring 5 and Hibernate 5. The web app keeps a track of customers. I have implemented basic CRUD features to create, view, update and delete customers. I have also implemented the search feature. I have used MySQL to store customers in the database and Tomcat for the server.
